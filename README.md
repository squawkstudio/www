# Squawk Studio Github Pages

This is a public repo to just enable Github Pages, with a branch named `gh-pages`, that is published to by repo for subfolders, e.g. www.home, www.timerz etc.
This repo must be `public` per Github, but the subfolder repos can remain as `private`.

Because caseful publishing this site in order to note destroy the contents of the subfoldres. So in order to limit the need to change this, it simply redirects to `home/`.
