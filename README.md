# Squawk Studio Github Pages

This is a public repo to just enable Github Pages, with a branch named `gh-pages`, that is published to by repo for subfolders, e.g. www.home, www.timerz etc.

Because caseful publishing this site in order to note destroy the contents of the subfoldres. So in order to limit the need to change this, it simply redirects to `home/`.
