# Squawk Studio GitHub Pages

This is a public repo to just enable [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/), with a branch named `gh-pages`, that is published to by repo for subfolders, e.g. `www.home`, `www.timerz`.

This repo must be `public` per Github, but the subfolder repos can remain as `private`.

Be careful publishing this site in order to not destroy the contents of the subfolders. 

To limit the need to change this repo, the `index.html` here simply redirects to `home/`, which is published from the repo `www.home`.
